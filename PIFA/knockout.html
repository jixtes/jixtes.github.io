		<h2 style="">Joey's idea on the Penality issue.</h2>

		<p>
			All the rules in pifa will stay the <strong>same</strong> even if the game goes to extra time. 
		</p>

		<p>
			The only addition is you have a chance to get a total of 4 points if you pridict a draw correct and also the penality shootout winner(you dont have to state the penality score)
		</p>

		<h3>Scenario 1</h3>
		<p>
		<b>Pridiction:</b> 2-1 <br><br>
		<b>Result:</b> The game ended 1-1 and after extra time it ended 2-1 <br><br>
		<b>Pts:</b> Will be considered as a Spot-On so 3pts <br><br>
		</p>
		<hr>

		<h3>Scenario 2</h3>
		<p>
		<b>Pridiction:</b> 1-1 Team A wins on Pen <br><br>
		<b>Result:</b> The game ended 1-1 and after extra time also 1-1; on the penality Team B wins <br><br>
		<b>Pts:</b> I get 3 points on the main pridiction but lost out on the penality so No extra point <br><br>
		<b>Note:</b> If I have said a 0-0 I'd have gotten 2 points only, just like the current rule
		</p>

		<h3>Scenario 3</h3>
		<p>
		<b>Pridiction:</b> 1-1 Team A wins on Pen <br><br>
		<b>Result:</b> The game ended 1-1 and after extra time also 1-1; on the penality Team A wins <br><br>
		<b>Pts:</b> I get 4 points beacause I get the main pridiction spot on and also picked the right team on the penality. <br><br>
